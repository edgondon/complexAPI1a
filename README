The user enters a two letter State into the query box to search for parks in a region, and sets a maximum amount of returned search items.
The returned results displayed on the screen include the Full Name of the park, the description of the park, as well as the Website URL address for the park.
Each time the user enters a new search (and presses the submit button), the screen will display results for the new search.
